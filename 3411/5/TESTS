Userprogram1 has a local output file and a remote input file
It directs the server to open the remote file, read input from it, and then gets
the input from the server. It writes this input to the local output file.

I tested this program with a variety of remote input contents. A blank input file
works, an previously existing output file works, a nonexistant output file works.
An input file with multiple lines works.

Userprogram2 has a remote output file and a local input file.
I tested this program in the same way as above, except the output file is remote
in this case, and input is local.
