To my knowledge everything works. There may be odd behavior in case of certain
system call failures. If Open fails and the user still tries to call Read there 
may be issues.
The system should properly handle not getting enough data from the socket (such
as attempting to read 4 bytes and only getting 2) because it will attempt to 
read again until it reads enough data. I am not positive that this works as I 
have had consistent network connections during all of my testing.

The server correctly creates a socket and listesn
The client correctly connects to the server given the appropriate host and port
Each of the RPCs described in the homework spec correctly receive input
Each of the RPCs described in the homework spec correctly returns results
Copying a file (by reading and then Writing) works correctly
This program should be interoperable.
